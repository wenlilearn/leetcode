 For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

Example:

Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is

module Main
# @param {Integer} area
# @return {Integer[]}
def construct_rectangle(area)
    dim1 = Math.sqrt(area).to_i

    for i in dim1.downto(1)
      if area % i == 0
          dim2 = area / i
          return [[i, dim2].max, [i, dim2].min]
      end
    end
end
end
